# Fly Finder

## The goal

As a paragliding pilot and AI enthusiast, this project is about a RAG project. The idea is to learn and understand how it works.

## The problem

It's demanding to analyze all forecasts for each launch site nearby. So, the idea is to notify the pilots how the forecast is going to be for free flight specifically. Is it going to be OK? Not ok? Maybe?

## The solution (part I)

So, at first, the product is to create an Ask Me Anything regarding Brazilian paragliding sites. What is the ideal wind direction? What are the features of each site? How to get there? Tips etc.

## The solution (part II)

The AI agent will notify the pilots of the forecast for free flight regarding the forecast. Is it going to be good for free flight? Is it going to be classic conditions? Not ok? Maybe?
