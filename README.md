# rag_paraglider

This is a RAG project. The idea is to learn and understand how it works.

So, at first, the product is to create an Ask me Anything regarding Brazilian paragliding sites. What is the ideal wind direction? What are the features of each site? How to get there? Tips etc.

The second part of this project is to warn users about flight conditions nearby.
